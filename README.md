# PF_PS_Indentation

Phase-Field simulation of an indentation test in the case of pressure solution. It uses [MOOSE](https://github.com/idaholab/moose) software. <br>
This work is inspired by previous experiments presented in the following papers:

- JP Gratier (1993) Experimental pressure solution of Halite by an indenter technique. Geophysical Research Letters 20: 1647-1650
- JP Gratier, R Guiguet, R Fran√ßois, L Jenatton, D Bernard (2009) A pressure solution creep law for quartz from indentation experiments. Journal of Geophysical Research 114:B03403

## Simulation presentation
The goal is to simulate the pressure solution phenomena (illustrated by the following scheme) between a grain and an indenter.
